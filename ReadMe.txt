This project is designed to function as an HTTP server. Its primary purpose is to serve static web pages (HTML and CSS, without JavaScript). To display an HTML file, add the file to the demo folder and insert addRoute(route, "/fileName", "file.html"); into main.c below line 14. Then, start the server and navigate to the localhost port displayed in your console.
